# Multivariate_analysis
 This RMarkdown is my midterm project for the Lab in Statistical Analysis. 

After a preliminary analysis, I fitted a multivariate linear regression. I added nonlinear components, then I used OLS robust to heteroskedasticy. After that, two power transformations (Box and Cox and Yeo-Johnons) are proposed, finally I fitted a Lasso regression and a Ridge regression
